I'm second-year student reading for a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Malta.

In my spare time, together with [Zack Xuereb](https://www.facebook.com/zack.xuereb1), I run a start-up called [AppLab](https://applab.com.mt), where we create secure and bespoke solutions for Web3 projects and websites alike. That aside, I currently work with [Dedaub](https://dedaub.com) as a Junior Software Engineer When it comes to learning, my curiosity mainly wanders towards cryptography, quantum computing, cyber security as well as mathematical analysis and education. 

Currently, I'm serving the University of Malta's Department of Mathematics as a Student Representative on the Board of Studies. Moreover, I'm also a member of the Malta Mathematical Society, where I have served for three years as it's Secretary General.
