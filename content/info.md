## Who am I

I'm a second-year student reading for a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Malta.

In my spare time, together with {{< person name="Zack Xuereb" url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zack-xuereb/" >}}, I run a start-up called [Avail](https://twitter.com/AvailWallet), where we develop solutions on the age-old problem of user experience surrounding traditional [fin-tech](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/what-is-fintech/) by proposing as self-custodial wallet for the private blockchain [Aleo](https://www.aleo.org/). That aside, I have worked with [Merqury Cybersecurity](https://www.merqury.eu/) and [Dedaub](https://dedaub.com) as a Software Engineer.

When it comes to learning, my curiosity mainly wanders towards cryptography,
quantum computing, cyber security as well as mathematical analysis and
education. 

Currently, I'm serving the University of Malta's Department of Mathematics as a Student Representative on the Board of Studies. Moreover, I'm also a member of the Malta Mathematical Society, where I have served for three years as it's Secretary General.
