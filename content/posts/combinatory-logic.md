The above video is the product of months worth of thinking, and three days of intensive work. 

Alexander Farrugia is a senior lecturer at the [Junior College](https://www.jc.um.edu.mt/). He also wrote a series of articles attempting to explain the basics of this subject on [quora](https://farrugiamaths.quora.com/Combinatory-logic-Using-math-boldsymbol-mathsf-S-math-and-math-boldsymbol-mathsf-K-math-Part-1)! 

After giving a talk at an event hosted by the [Malta Mathematical Society](facebook.com/maltamathsoc), a couple of years back from the writing of this article, Alex managed to pique my interest on the topic. Fast forward to the date of writing of this article, Alex taught me the basics of combinatory logic and we produced an animation using  [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) â€“  an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for creating explanatory math videos.
