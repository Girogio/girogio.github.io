This challenge was in the misc category of the first GDG Algiers CTF due to involving quantum computing. In my opinion, a well founded knowledge of cryptography is useful in this challenge as shown later.

Thanks to the basics track of the Qalypso Summer School I was able to fully understand the challenge and use the intended solution.

## kvant.py
The first function in `kvant.py` is basically the application of the ket notation on a binary number.

```py
def get_state(x):
    l = [0] * 2**len(x)
    l[int(x, 2)] = 1
    return l
```
In mathematical terms, it maps a binary number string $b$ of length $n$ (corresponding to a decimal number $x$) to an array of size $2^n$ whose entries are all $0$ except for the $x^ \text{th}$ one, which is $1$. An example:
$$\verb|get_state('01')| = \ket{01} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0\end{pmatrix} = \verb|[0, 1, 0, 0]|$$

The next two functions should be self explanatory:

```py
def str2bin(s):
    return ''.join(bin(ord(i))[2:].zfill(8) for i in s)

def bin2str(a):
    return ''.join(chr(int(a[i:i+8], 2)) for i in range(0, len(a), 8))
```
<br/>


Now comes the interesting part. The following function expects an initial state vector and creates a single qubit quantum circuit. Thus the initial state must be an array of size $2^1$.

```py
def encode_1(initial_state):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
    qc.initialize(initial_state)
    qc.x(0)
    qc.save_statevector()
    qobj = assemble(qc)
    state = sim.run(qobj).result()
    return list(state.get_statevector().real.astype(int))
```
It is to be noted that the above circuit performs the Qiskit `.x()` gate (`NOT`) on the $0^\text{th}$ qubit of the circuit, returning the resultant state vector. Given our definitions of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, the possible results can be as follows:

$$\verb|NOT| \ket{0} = \verb|NOT| \begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\end{pmatrix} = \ket{1}$$

$$\verb|NOT| \ket{1} = \verb|NOT| \begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\end{pmatrix} = \ket{0}$$

<br/>

The second encoding function happens to be a 2-qubit circuit, hence expecting a state vector of size $2^2$ as an input.

```py
def encode_2(initial_state):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.initialize(initial_state)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.save_statevector()
    qobj = assemble(qc)
    state = sim.run(qobj).result()
    return list(state.get_statevector().real.astype(int))
```
This time however, a `.cx()` gate (`CNOT`) is being applied to the 2 qubits â€“ the 0th and 1st bit being the control and target bits respectively. The `CNOT` gate simply flips the target bit, only if the control bit is set to 1 and does nothing otherwise. Fortunately, mathematics comes to the rescue with a handy matrix definition for the `CNOT` gate:

$$\verb|CNOT| := \begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\\\0&1&0&0\\\\0&0&0&1\\\\0&0&1&0\\\\\end{pmatrix}$$

Its effect on a $1\times 4$ matrix $M$ is replicable by swapping the last and second to last entries of $M$, i.e.
$$\verb|CNOT| \begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\\\c\\\\d\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\\\0&1&0&0\\\\0&0&0&1\\\\0&0&1&0\\\\\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\\\c\\\\d\end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\\\d\\\\c\end{pmatrix}$$

Some exapmles with prepared states:


$$\verb|CNOT| \ket{11} = \verb|CNOT| \begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\1\\\\0\end{pmatrix} $$
